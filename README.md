# some_cmake_test

A small compilation of static analysis tools, unit test, fuzzing, documentation and logging tools linked to a CI server.

## Static analysis (cppcheck, cpplint)

TODO

## Unit tests (Catch2)
### With colcon
We'll source ROS 2 but we actually only need colcon which is ROS 2 independent, it's just easier to source the whole thing and since colcon is most likely only used with ROS 2, it doesn't really matter if we source ROS 2.

Source ROS 2 and build with tests:
```
source /opt/ros/dashing/setup.bash
colcon build --cmake-args -DBUILD_TESTING=ON
```

Go run the tests:
```
cd <my_package>/build/some_cmake_test/test
ctest --output-on-failure
```

### With pure CMake

Should work with cmake, something like:
```
cd <my_package>
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DBUILD_TESTING=ON ..
make
cd test
ctest --output-on-failure
```

## Fuzzing (?)

TODO

## Documentation (Doxygen)

Install doxygen on your system:
```
sudo apt install doxygen
```

Generate the documentation:
```
cd <my_package>/documentation
doxygen doxygen.conf
```

Check the generated documentation by opening `html/index.html` in your browser.


## Logging (spdlog)

TODO

## CI (Jenkins CI)

Check the [Jenkinsfile](Jenkinsfile) in this repository and the [Jenkins CI server](http://hopermf-desktop.local:8080/job/cmake_package_pipeline/) (only accessible from local network).

## Code coverage (gcovr)


Install gcovr on your system:
```
sudo -H pip install gcovr
```

TODO: fix coverage with external tools (spdlog)
Generate the code coverage data as html:
```
cd build
mkdir coverage
gcovr -r .. --filter '\.\./src/' --filter '\.\./include/' --html-details -o coverage/coverage.html 
```

Or generate the code coverage data as XML:
```
cd build
gcovr -r .. --filter '\.\./src/' --filter '\.\./include/' --xml-pretty -o coverage.xml 
```
